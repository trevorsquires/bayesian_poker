# Bayesian Poker Simulator

This repo contains the code necessary to perform a simulation comparing Bayesian vs Frequentist strategies in Texas Hold'em poker as detailed in [here.](https://trevorsquires.com/subpages/bayesian_poker) 

To run the simulation, simply run the script main.py which requires very few, if any, packages preinstalled. As a note, the repo is in pretty bad shape.  My goal for the project was to explore the mathematical side of things while supporting them with a Monte-Carlo simulation.  At the onset of the project, however, I did not realize exactly how much of an undertaking the code would be. The design of the repo is fairly short-sighted, the doc strings are lacking, and the speed optimizations are not up to their normal standards.  However, the main goal was not the code itself and this will likely remain the case for the continuation of the project.
